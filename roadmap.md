# 🗺️ CHARLOTTE Project Roadmap

Welcome to the official roadmap for **C-H-A-R-L-O-T-T-E** — our haunted, LLM-powered reverse engineering and security assistant with an attitude. This document outlines current goals, upcoming features, and long-term ambitions. Feel free to open issues or PRs tied to any item here!

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Core Architecture (✅ In Progress)
- [x] Modular plugin system for task routing
- [x] CLI interface with interactive menu
- [x] Local model fallback via Hugging Face transformers
- [x] Reverse engineering plugin scaffolding
- [x] Runtime analysis framework

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Plugin Ecosystem (🔄 Active Development)
- [ ] **ThreatMapper Integration**  
  - Parse API output from ThreatMapper  
  - Enrich CHARLOTTE's triage using runtime context and cloud misconfigurations  
  - Support both agent-based and agentless deployments
- [ ] **Binary Ninja / Ghidra Plugin**  
  - Symbolic tracing and basic decompilation  
  - Export CFG, instruction summaries, function signatures
- [ ] **Secrets/Leak Scanner Plugin**  
  - Detect and categorize exposed secrets in repos or memory dumps
- [ ] **CTF Toolkit Plugin**  
  - Automate solving simple reversing, crypto, or pwn challenges

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: LLM & Prompt Engineering
- [ ] Unified `llm_interface.py` to manage model routing (local vs. remote)
- [ ] Secure prompt injection handling
- [ ] Prompt libraries for:
  - Vulnerability explanation
  - Malware triage summary
  - Disassembler annotation assistance

---

## 🔐 Phase 4: Security Posture Assessment
- [ ] Merge ThreatMapper signals with local scan context
- [ ] Exploitability scoring using eBPF runtime data
- [ ] CSPM + CWPP scoring summary per asset/container

---

## 📦 Phase 5: Packaging and Community
- [ ] Dockerized deployment
- [ ] GitHub Actions for testing plugins
- [ ] Contributor CLI scaffolding (`charlotte plugin create`)
- [ ] CHARLOTTE CLI personalization (theme, sarcasm level, verbosity)

---

## 🧪 Stretch Goals
- [ ] Discord/Slack bot mode
- [ ] GUI dashboard (React-based or TUI)
- [ ] Integration with Volatility for memory forensics
- [ ] Integration with OSQuery or Sysmon logs

---
